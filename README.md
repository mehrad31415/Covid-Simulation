# Covid-Simulation

This is a Covid Simulation program written in Python.

In this program, multiple random routes are generated in each running. The number of routes can be modified in each running. Each route represents a person who has taken a that path. Should we indicate that a person has caught Covid-19, the hotspot areas; i.e., the points where the person has been for a certain amount can be identified. The routes from that point which are in the approximate distance (this can be modified) will be highlighted in each running. The result is shown in an Excel and geospatial vizualization. I believe this program in a larger scale could be effective in Covid-19 tracking.
