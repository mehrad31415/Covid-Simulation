# Covid-Simulation

This is a Covid Simulation program written in Python.

In this program, multiple random routes are generated. The number of routes can be modified in each running. In each running, each routes represents a person who has taken a that path. 
Given a defined distance in the program, should we indicate that a person (equivalently a path) is infectious with Covid-19, the paths in the approximate defined distance of that person will be highlighted in each running.
The result is shown in an Excel and geospatial vizualization. I believe this program in a larger scale could be effective in Covid-19 tracking.
